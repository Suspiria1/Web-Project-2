        <h2>Gold Medal</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I won this gold medal in a 400m relay back at my school in Thompson,
          Manitoba. I was a member of the Westwood Vikings and my team got
          first. This was a huge achievement that I am proud of.

        <h2>Knowledgehook Medal</h2>
        <br />
        <!-- span element to change the paragraph color to black -->
        <p>
          This is another gold medal I got for doing math questions in
          Knowledgehook. Knowledgehook is an educational tech company that
          provides students with online math learning. I basically got this
          medal for knowing math, which is pretty nice.

        <h2>Piano Awards</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I won two piano awards at the Winnipeg Music Festival in March 2021.
          At that time, the virus was a big problem so I had to record myself
          playing these pieces and send them online. I practiced a lot for these
          pieces.
