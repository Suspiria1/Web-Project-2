      <h1>My Extracurricular Activities</h1>
      <p>
        I have a couple of hobbies and interests. These include playing
        badminton, going for bike rides, and playing board games. Being able to
        try out different things is something I look forward to.

        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          One of my extracurricular activities include playing the piano. I
          started playing the piano on August 2020 and I'm still playing since
          then. I enjoy playing the piano because I like music. Music is what
          keeps me energetic and keeps me entertained.

        <h2>Badminton</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I enjoy playing badminton because it is a great sport in general. I
          will always play badminton when I get the chance. You need to use some
          brain power to play the game because it can get competitive. Hitting
          the birdie and getting a point feels nice and is a reason why I like
          it. Not only is this sport fun, there is also some movement required
          which makes the game challenging.

        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Chess is an entertaining board game and very strategic. Capturing the
          enemy king is always a challenge for me. Chess involves critical
          thinking which makes the game difficult. I played chess for over a
          year and I have improved a bit over the months. I also participated in
          a chess club at my school and unfortunately did not win, but it was a
          great experience.
